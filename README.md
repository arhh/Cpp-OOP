# Hypothetical House Maker
A small project I developed using C++ Object Oriented Programming techniques.

## Description:
A menu based command line program whereby a user can create a house object with attributes including its room count, dimensions, and description. After the house is created, its attributes can be displayed or updated, the program can be terminated along with the house.

## Notes:
* As I intended this project to be a demonstration of my C++ OOP knowledge rather a full featured program, there are notable omissions that would usually be present in a programming project (e.g. User input validation).
